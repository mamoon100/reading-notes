### Html&Css:
* #### Introduction
    **How the Web Works**
> When you visit a website, the web server hosting that site could be anywhere in the world. In order for you to find the location of the web server, your browser will first connect to a Domain Name System (DNS) server.


* #### Structure 
    **How Pages Use Structure**

>Think about the stories you read in a newspaper: for each story, there will be a headline, some text, and possibly some images. If the article is a long piece, there may be subheadings that split the story into separate sections or quotes from those involved. Structure helps readers understand the stories in the newspaper, The structure is very similar when a news story is viewed online (although it may also feature audio or video). This is illustrated on the right with a copy of a newspaper alongside the corresponding article on its website.
Now think about a very different type of document — an insurance form.
Insurance forms often have headings for different sections, and each section contains a list of questions with areas for you to fill in details or checkboxes to tick. Again, the structure is very similar online.


* #### Extra Markup 
    **ID Attribute:**
    > Every HTML element can carry the id attribute. It is used to uniquely identify that element from other elements on the page. Its value should start with a letter or an underscore (not a number or any other character). It is important that no two elements on the same page have the same value for their id attributes (otherwise the value is no longer unique)

    **Class Attribute:**
    > Every HTML element can also carry a class attribute. Sometimes, rather than uniquely identifying one element within a document, you will want a way to identify several elements as being different from the other elements on the page. For example, you might have some paragraphs of text that contain information that is more important than others and want to distinguish these elements, or you might want to differentiate between links that point to other pages on your own site and links that point to external sites.

* #### Html5 Layout 
    **Headers & Footers:**
    > The ``<header>`` and ``<footer>`` elements can be used for:
    > * The main header or footer that appears at the top or bottom of every page on the site.
    > * A header or footer for an individual ``<article>`` or ``<section>`` within the page.


* #### Process & Design
    **Who is the Site For?**
    > Every website should be designed for the target audience—not just for yourself or the site owner. It is therefore very important to understand who your target audience is.

    **Why People Visit YOUR Website**
    > Now that you know who your visitors are, you need to consider why they are coming. While some people will simply chance across your website, most will visit for a specific reason.

    **What Your Visitors are Trying to Achieve**
    > It is unlikely that you will be able to list every reason why someone visits your site but you are looking for key tasks and motivations. This information can help guide your site designs.


### Java Script
* #### Introduction Js
    **What is Java Script**
    > an object-oriented computer programming language commonly used to create interactive effects within web browsers.

    **How JS make the website more pages more interactive**
    > JavaScript allows you to make web pages more interacrive by accessing and modifying the content and markup used in a web page while it is being viewed in the browser.

* #### ABC
    * ##### A
        **WRITING A SCRIPT**
        > To write a script, you need to first state your goal and then list the tasks that need to be completed in order to achieve it
    * ##### B
        **PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER**
        > Computers use data to create models of things in the real world. The events, methods, and properties of an object all relate to each other: Events can trigger methods, and methods can retrieve or update an object's properties.
    * ##### C
        **CREATING A BAS IC JAVASCRIPT**
        > JavaScript is written in plain text, just like HTML and CSS, so you do not need any new tools to write a script.

    * ##### Summry
        **How do i write a script for a web page?**
        * It is best to keep JavaScript code in its own JavaScript file. JavaScript files are text files (like HTML pages and CSS style sheets), but they have the . j s extension.
        * The HTML ``<script>`` element is used in HTML pages to tell the browser to load the JavaScript file (rather like the ``<link>`` element can be used to load a CSS file).
        * If you view the source code of the page in the browser, the JavaScript will not have changed the HTML, because the script works with the model of the web page that the browser has created.
