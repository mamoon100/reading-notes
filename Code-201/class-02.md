### Text
>  When creating a web page, you add tags (known as markup) to the contents of the page. These tags provide extra meaning and allow browsers to show users the appropriate structure for the page.

* #### Headings
> HTML has six "levels" of headings:

* ``<h1>`` is used for main headings, ``<h2>`` is used for subheadings If there are further sections under the subheadings then the ``<h3>`` element is used, and so on...
> Browsers display the contents of headings at different sizes. The contents of an ``<h1>`` element is the largest, and the contents of an ``<h6>`` element is the smallest. The exact size at which each browser shows the headings can vary slightly. Users can also adjust the size of text in their browser. You will see how to control the size of text, its color, and the fonts used when we come to look at CSS.

### Introducing CSS
> CSS allows you to create rules that specify how the content of an element should appear. For example, you can specify that the background of the page is cream, all paragraphs should appear in gray using the Arial typeface, or that all level one headings should be in a blue, italic, Times typeface.

> The key to understanding how CSS works is to imagine that there is an invisible box around every HTML element.

> CSS works by associating rules with HTML elements. These rules govern how the content of specified elements should be

### Basic JavaScript Instructions
* Statement
> A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow one-by-one. Each individual instruction or step is known as a statement. Statements should end with a semicolon ``;`` .
* COMMENTS
> You should write comments to explain what your code does. They help make your code easier to read and understand. This can help you and others who read your code.

* EXPRESSIONS
> An expression evaluates into (results in) a single value. Broadly speaking there are two types of expressions. You can perform operations on any number of individual values to determine a single value. For example:
``var area = 3 * 2;`` The Value of area is **6**

* ARITHMETITC OPERATORS:

### Decisions and Loops 
> Looking at a flowchart (for all but the most basic scripts), the code can take more than one path, which means the browser runs different code in different situations. In this chapter, you will learn how to create and control the flow of data in your scripts to handle different situations.
