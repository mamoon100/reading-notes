### Images

> A picture can say a thousand words, and great images help make the difference between an average-looking site and a really engaging one.

* **Adding Images:**

To add an image into the page you need to use an ``<img>`` element. This is an empty element (which means there is no **closing tag**). It must carry the following two attributes:

1. **src:** This tells the browser where it can find the image file. This will usually be a relative URL pointing to an image on your own site.

2. **alt:** This provides a text description of the image which describes the image if you cannot see it.


* **JPEG vs PNG vs GIF:**

> Use JPEG format for all images that contain a natural scene or photograph where variation in colour and intensity is smooth. Use PNG format for any image that needs transparency or for images with text & objects with sharp contrast edges like logos. Use GIF format for images that contain animations.

### Color
**Color can really bring your pages to life.**

The **color** property allows you to specify the **color** of text inside an element. You can specify any **color** in CSS in one of three ways:

1. **RGB values:** These express colors in terms of how much red, green and blue are used to make it up. For example: *rgb(100,100,90)*.

2. **hex codes:** These are six-digit codes that represent the amount of red, green and blue in a color, preceded by a pound or hash *#* sign. For example: *#ee3e80*

3. **Color Names:** There are 147 predefined color names that are recognized by browsers. For example: *DarkCyan*.
