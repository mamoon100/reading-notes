# Grouth mindset
##### The **Grouth mindset** meaning is that evry day that you will try to learn somthing new no matter how good you are and no matter how ~~perfect~~  your work is.
--------
#### Reminders for me to stay in **Grouth mindset**:
1. you will never get the **Perfect** work so keep learning and devolpe your self.
2. Don't shame yourself or other for simple or beginner work .
3. don't get *Arrogance* about your knowledge.
