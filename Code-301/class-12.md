## What does SQL stand for?

Structured Query Language

## What is a relational database?

a database structured to recognize relations between stored items of information.

## What type of structure does a relational database work with?

Relational databases are based on the relational model, an intuitive, straightforward way of representing data in tables.

## What is a ‘schema’?

The database schema is its structure described in a formal language supported by the database management system. The term "schema" refers to the organization of data as a blueprint of how the database is constructed.

## What is a NoSQL database?

A NoSQL database provides a mechanism for storage and retrieval of data that is modeled in means other than the tabular relations used in relational databases. Such databases have existed since the late 1960s, but the name "NoSQL" was only coined in the early 21st century, triggered by the needs of Web 2.0 companies.

## How does it work?

NoSQL databases store data in documents rather than relational tables. Accordingly, we classify them as "not only SQL" and subdivide them by a variety of flexible data models. Types of NoSQL databases include pure document databases, key-value stores, wide-column databases, and graph databases.

## What is inside of a Mongo database?

MongoDB stores data records as documents (specifically BSON documents) which are gathered together in collections. A database stores one or more collections of documents.

## Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why.

MongoDB is more flexible and ensures high and diverse data availability

## What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?

NoSQL databases don't have the reliability functions which Relational Databases have (basically don't support ACID). This also means that NoSQL databases offer consistency in performance and scalability.
