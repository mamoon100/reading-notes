# FUNCTIONAL PROGRAMMING

## What is functional programming?

Functional programming (often abbreviated FP) is the process of building software by composing pure functions, avoiding shared state, mutable data, and side-effects. Functional programming is declarative rather than imperative, and application state flows through pure functions.

## What is a pure function and how do we know if something is a pure function?

A pure function is a function which: Given the same input, will always return the same output. Produces no side effects.

## What are the benefits of a pure function?

Pure functions are much easier to read and reason about. All relevant inputs and dependencies are provided as parameters, so no effects are observed that alter variables outside of the set of inputs. This means that we can quickly understand a function and its dependencies, just by reading the function's declaration.

## What is immutability?

In object-oriented and functional programming, an immutable object is an object whose state cannot be modified after it is created.

## What is Referential transparency?

Referential transparency and referential opacity are properties of parts of computer programs. An expression is called referentially transparent if it can be replaced with its corresponding value without changing the program's behavior

## What is a module?

Modular programming is a software design technique that emphasizes separating the functionality of a program into independent, interchangeable modules, such that each contains everything necessary to execute only one aspect of the desired functionality.

## What does the word ‘require’ do?

require() is used to consume modules. It allows you to include modules in your app. You can add built-in core Node. js modules, community-based modules (node_modules), and local modules too.

## How do we bring another module into the file the we are working in?

by require statement

## What do we have to do to make a module available?

exporting it at the end of the file
