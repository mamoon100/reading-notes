# Functions

Functions are one of the fundamental building blocks in JavaScript. A function in JavaScript is similar to a procedureâ€”a set of statements that performs a task or calculates a value, but for a procedure to qualify as a function, it should take some input and return an output where there is some obvious relationship between the input and the output. To use a function, you must define it somewhere in the scope from which you wish to call it.

## Defining functions

A **function definition** (also called a **function declaration**, or **function statement**) consists of the function keyword, followed by:

* The name of the function.
* A list of parameters to the function, enclosed in parentheses and separated by commas.
* The JavaScript statements that define the function, enclosed in curly brackets, ``{...}``.

For example, the following code defines a simple function named **square**:

> **function** square(number) {
  return number * number;
}



## Calling functions 

Defining a function does not execute it. Defining it names the function and specifies what to do when the function is called.

Calling the function actually performs the specified actions with the indicated parameters. For example, if you define the function square, you could call it as follows:

> square(5);
